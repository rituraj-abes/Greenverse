# Greenverse Air Quality Monitor Project

This repository contains the files and code developed during my internship at **Greenverse Pvt. Limited**. During this internship, I had the opportunity to create an **Air Quality Monitor** from scratch, utilizing my skills in embedded systems, sensor integration, and cloud services.

## Project Overview

The Air Quality Monitor is designed to measure environmental parameters such as air quality and send the data to the cloud for analysis and monitoring. The core components of the system include:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Responsible for interfacing with various sensors and communicating with the cloud.
- **AWS IoT**: The sensor data is transmitted to AWS IoT, where it can be stored, processed, and analyzed for real-time insights.

## Key Learnings

During the course of this project, I learned and implemented several important technologies and protocols, including:

- **I2C Protocol**: Used for communication between the microcontroller and connected sensors.
- **RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)**: Enabled efficient task scheduling and resource management within the ESP32.
- **WiFiManager**: This library allows the device to connect to Wi-Fi networks without hardcoding credentials, making the system more flexible and user-friendly.
- **AWS IoT Cloud Services**: Used for securely transmitting, storing, and analyzing the sensor data.

## Features

- **Real-time Air Quality Monitoring**
- **Cloud Connectivity via AWS IoT**
- **Modular and Scalable Design**

Feel free to explore the code and learn more about the technical aspects of this project!
